**An intelligent AI-powered chatbot that answers questions about your college/university
using real institutional data — courses, admissions, placements, library, and more.**

</div>

---

## What Does This Project Do?

Imagine you're a new student at a college and you have hundreds of questions:

- *"What is the fee structure?"*
- *"When do admissions start?"*
- *"What companies come for placements?"*
- *"How many books can I borrow from the library?"*

Instead of searching through multiple websites or calling different offices,
you simply **type your question** and the chatbot **instantly gives you an accurate answer** — just like chatting with a helpful senior who knows everything about the college!

### How is it "Context-Aware"?

Unlike a normal chatbot that gives generic answers, EduBot is **smart** because:

1. **It knows your institution** — It comes pre-loaded with data about departments, fees, placements, faculty, etc.
2. **You can feed it documents** — Upload your college prospectus, syllabus PDFs, or policy documents, and it will **learn from them** to give even better answers.
3. **It remembers your conversation** — It understands follow-up questions (e.g., you ask "Tell me about CSE" and then "What are its specializations?" — it knows you're still talking about CSE).

## Prerequisites (What You Need to Install First)

Before running EduBot, you need **two things** installed on your computer:

### 1. Python (version 3.8 or higher)

Python is the programming language this project is written in.

**Check if you already have Python:**
Open your Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows) and type:
```bash
python3 --version
```
If you see something like `Python 3.10.12`, you're good! If not, install it:

| Operating System | How to Install |
|-----------------|----------------|
| **Windows** | Go to [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/), download the installer, run it. **IMPORTANT: Check the box "Add Python to PATH" during installation!** |
| **Mac** | Open Terminal and run: `brew install python3` (if you have Homebrew) OR download from [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/) |
| **Linux (Ubuntu)** | Open Terminal and run: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv` |

### 2. Ollama (the AI engine)

Ollama is what runs the AI model on your computer. It's free and easy to install.

**Install Ollama:**

| Operating System | How to Install |
|-----------------|----------------|
| **Windows** | Go to [ollama.com](https://ollama.com), click Download, run the installer |
| **Mac** | Go to [ollama.com](https://ollama.com), click Download, drag to Applications. OR run: `brew install ollama` |
| **Linux** | Open Terminal and run: `curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh \| sh` |

**After installing Ollama, download an AI model:**

Open your Terminal/Command Prompt and run:
```bash
ollama pull llama3.2
```

This downloads a ~2GB AI model to your computer. It only needs to be done once.
Wait for it to finish (it may take a few minutes depending on your internet speed).

> **Note:** If your computer has less than 8GB RAM, use a smaller model instead:
> ```bash
> ollama pull phi3
> ```
> Then change the model name in `config.py` (explained in Configuration section below).

---

## How to Run the Project (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Download the Project

If you received this as a ZIP file, extract it to a folder on your computer.

If you're using Git:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd edu-chatbot
```

### Step 2: Start Ollama

Open a **new Terminal/Command Prompt window** and run:
```bash
ollama serve
```
Keep this window open! Ollama needs to be running in the background.

> **On Mac:** If you installed Ollama as an app, just open it from Applications — it runs automatically in the background.

### Step 3: Run EduBot

**Option A — Easy Way (Mac/Linux):**
```bash
cd edu-chatbot
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```

**Option B — Manual Way (All Operating Systems):**

```bash
# Navigate to the project folder
cd edu-chatbot

# Create a virtual environment (isolates project dependencies)
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# Install required packages
pip install flask flask-socketio requests werkzeug gevent gevent-websocket

# Run the application
python3 app.py
```

### Step 4: Open in Browser

Once you see the message:
```
============================================================
  EduBot - Context-Aware Educational Chatbot
============================================================
  Open http://localhost:5000 in your browser
============================================================
```

Open your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) and go to:

```
http://localhost:5000
```

You should see the beautiful EduBot interface! Start chatting!

### Step 5: To Stop the Application

- Press `Ctrl + C` in the Terminal where the app is running
- Close the Ollama window too (or press `Ctrl + C` there)

## Configuration (Changing Settings)

### Changing the AI Model

Open `config.py` and change the `OLLAMA_MODEL` value:

```python
OLLAMA_MODEL = os.environ.get("OLLAMA_MODEL", "llama3.2")
#                                                ^^^^^^^^
#                                        Change this to any model you have
```

**Popular models you can use:**
| Model | Size | Best For |
|-------|------|----------|
| `llama3.2` | ~2GB | General use (recommended) |
| `llama3.2:1b` | ~1.3GB | Low-RAM computers |
| `mistral` | ~4GB | Good quality responses |
| `phi3` | ~2GB | Fast, lightweight |
| `gemma2` | ~5GB | High quality |

Remember to pull the model first:
```bash
ollama pull <model-name>
```

### Customizing Institution Data

The file `knowledge_base/institution_data.json` contains all the institution information.
Open it in any text editor and replace the data with your actual college/university details:

- Institution name, address, website
- Department names, HODs, programs
- Fee structure, admission process
- Placement statistics
- Library details
- Scholarships
- And more!

The chatbot automatically loads this data when it starts.

## Troubleshooting (Common Problems & Solutions)

### "Cannot connect to Ollama"
**Problem:** The chatbot shows "Ollama offline" in the sidebar.
**Solution:**
1. Make sure Ollama is running. Open a terminal and run: `ollama serve`
2. Make sure you've downloaded a model: `ollama pull llama3.2`
3. Check if Ollama is accessible: open `http://localhost:11434` in your browser — you should see "Ollama is running"

### "Module not found" error
**Problem:** You see `ModuleNotFoundError` when running `python3 app.py`
**Solution:**
```bash
# Make sure your virtual environment is activated
source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows

# Install dependencies again
pip install flask flask-socketio requests werkzeug
```

### "Port 5000 already in use"
**Problem:** Another application is using port 5000.
**Solution:** Close the other application, or change the port in `app.py`:
```python
socketio.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8080, debug=True)
#                                       ^^^^
#                               Change to any free port
```
Then open `http://localhost:8080` instead.

### Slow responses
**Problem:** The AI takes too long to respond.
**Solution:**
- Use a smaller/faster model: `ollama pull phi3` and update `config.py`
- Close other heavy applications to free up RAM
- The first response is always slower (model loading). Subsequent ones are faster.

### "Address already in use" on Mac
**Problem:** macOS AirPlay Receiver uses port 5000 by default.
**Solution:** Go to System Settings > General > AirDrop & Handoff > turn off AirPlay Receiver. OR change the port as shown above.
